Amro Zaid - Mobile Developer Portfolio (Lab 2.1)

Overview

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, refactored and updated from Lab 1. The primary goal of this revision was to build a modern, professional, and responsive website using Bootstrap 5 to showcase my academic background and unique technical skills.

The site is fully responsive and optimized for viewing across all devices.

Key Features & Technologies

🚀 Technical Implementation

Framework: Built entirely using Bootstrap 5 for modern styling and layout management.

Version Control: Managed using Git and hosted publicly on GitHub.

Responsiveness: Utilizes the Bootstrap Grid System (.row, .col-\*) to ensure a flawless display on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Interactivity: Implements custom vanilla JavaScript functions (fun1, fun2) to toggle the visibility of "fun facts" within the skills section.
